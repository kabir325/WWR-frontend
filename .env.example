# EC2 Proxy Configuration (recommended)
# This is the URL of your EC2 proxy server
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-ec2-tailscale-ip:3001

# For production with Vercel, use your EC2 public IP or domain:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://ec2-your-public-ip.compute.amazonaws.com:3001
# Or with custom domain: https://api.yourdomain.com

# Note: The frontend will automatically discover players through the proxy
# No need to configure individual Pi IPs here
